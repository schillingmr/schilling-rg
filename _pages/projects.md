## Current Projects

### Perspectives and Paradigms of Collaboration and Rural STEM Workforce Development
The purpose of this project is to explore the perspectives on the purpose, paradigms, and collaborative nature of rural STEM workforce development. This project leverages a participatory research approach, informed by frameworks of systems thinking and collaboration, to explore stakeholders’ perspectives related to STEM workforce development to address the following research questions: 

  * RQ1: How do stakeholders in STEM workforce development describe its purpose?
  * RQ2: How do stakeholders in STEM workforce development characterize and understand collaboration in this context?
  * RQ3: What are the common STEM workforce paradigms held by stakeholders in these contexts?
  * RQ4: What should efforts for rural STEM workforce development look like?

### Rural Undergraduate Engineering Students' Engineering Identities and Rural Cultural Wealth
The purpose of this phenomenological study is to explore how rural engineering students leverage aspects of rural cultural wealth as a means to developing their engineering identity through the following research questions: 

  * RQ1: What assets and experiences lead to rural engineering students developing their engineering identities?
  * RQ2: How do rural engineering students describe and make meaning of their rural identities relative to their other identities?
  * RQ3: How does the intersection of rural identity, engineering identity, and other marginalized identities play a role in rural engineering students’ persistence?

### Rural Community College and Four Year Engineering Students' Engineering Identity
Using data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09) from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the purpose of this project is to better understand characteristics of engineering identity for rural community college engineering students and rural four year engineering students.
