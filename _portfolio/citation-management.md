Information about shared citation management in SRG

There are many different citations managers to choose from but the one that will be leveraged by SRG is [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).

Please make an account with Zotero to be added to the Schilling Research Group Library where you can find and upload references for general use and specific projects. 

Zotero can be integrated with Microsoft Word and with Google Docs. I also recommend installing the plugin for your web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari), which allows you to easily upload data from articles you read in your browser. I highly recommend installing the software directly to your computer. 

Additional tools I recommend are:
1. [LibKey Nomad Extension](https://askalibrarian.asu.edu/faq/342338): This will make accessing journal articles a bit easier and should link directly to ASU Library.
2. [Google Scholar](scholar.google.com): I recommend that you start with setting up your own Google Scholar profile as a way to track your own papers and how they are cited once you start publishing. Google Scholar is also a useful tool for quickly locating references and can be linked to the ASU Library:
   - Go to Google Scholar
   - Click the menu (three bars in the upper left side of the screen)
   - Click Settings
   - Click Library Link
   - Enter ASU Library link
3. [Citation Chaser](https://estech.shinyapps.io/citationchaser/): A tool for backward and forward citation chasing (i.e., the references in an article and how that article has been cited, respectively). This can be helpful for locating literature for literature reviews and for locating references related to a topic.
