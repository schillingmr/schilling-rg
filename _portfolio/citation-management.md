Information about shared citation management in SRG

There are many different citations managers to choose from but the one that will be leveraged by SRG is [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).

Please make an account with Zotero to be added to the Schilling Research Group Library where you can find and upload references for general use and specific projects. 

Zotero can be integrated with Microsoft Word and with Google Docs. I also recommend installing the plugin for your web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari), which allows you to easily upload data from articles you read in your browser. I highly recommend installing the software directly to your computer.
